"""
Standalone policy inference for the SO101 PlaceCube checkpoint — Linux (Ubuntu).

Linux port of infer.py. Differences from the macOS original:
    - Cv2Camera uses cv2.CAP_V4L2 (the Linux-native Video4Linux2 backend)
      instead of cv2.CAP_AVFOUNDATION.
    - ROBOT_PORT default points to /dev/ttyACM0 (typical Feetech USB-serial
      enumeration on Linux). Use `ls /dev/tty{ACM,USB}*` to find yours.
    - V4L2 generally hands you a valid frame on the first read, so the
      AVFoundation-style multi-second warm-up loop is shortened. The retry
      stays in place to absorb slow USB negotiation on first plug-in.

Everything else (policy network, obs/action contract, calibration mapping)
is byte-for-byte identical to infer.py so checkpoints load unchanged.

Usage:
    python infer_linux.py --checkpoint ckpt.pt --goal_color 0

Goal colors: 0 red  1 blue  2 green  3 yellow  4 purple  5 orange
