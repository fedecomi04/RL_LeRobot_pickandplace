"""
EVAL 2 — two-cube pick: SPLIT-then-pick on the SO101 robot — Linux (Ubuntu).

Same task as EVAL 1 (infer_linux.py) but the scene now has TWO cubes that may
be touching/overlapping. EVAL 2 runs two policies back-to-back per episode:

  Phase A — SPLIT.  A dedicated "split" policy nudges the two cubes apart so the
    goal cube can later be grasped cleanly. There is no clean state-based "cubes
    are separated" signal, so the phase is timed off the arm: it runs the split
    policy until the FK end-effector descends below --split_below_z (default
    6 cm above the table), then for --split_run_s more seconds (default 8 s),
    then stops. The split policy uses a smaller --split_action_scale (default
    0.2). Masking during the split is BACKGROUND-ONLY (table mask, no cube-colour
    mask) — the split policy must see BOTH cubes.

  → return to the rest pose (initial place).

  Phase B — EVAL 1 PICK.  The robot then runs the unchanged EVAL 1 policy +
    FK-gated hardcoded grasp, with the full mask stack: background (table) mask
    AND the cube-colour mask that greys the non-goal cube when it isn't the goal
    colour. This is byte-for-byte the EVAL 1 control loop from infer_linux.py.

Everything else (policy network, obs/action contract, camera, calibration,
recording/upload) is identical to infer_linux.py so checkpoints load unchanged.

Usage:
    python infer_eval2_linux.py --goal_color 0
    # checkpoint1 (pick) and checkpoint2 (split) both default to the bundled
    # final_utils/{pick_place_policy,split_policy}.pt; override either, or skip
    # the split with --no-split. NOTE: final_utils/eval2.py is the canonical
    # final EVAL 2 script (single source of truth); this standalone mirrors it.
